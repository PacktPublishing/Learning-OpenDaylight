# Learning OpenDaylight
This is the code repository for [Learning OpenDayLight](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-opendaylight?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782174523), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
OpenDaylight is an open source, software-defined network controller based on standard protocols. It aims to accelerate the adoption of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and create a solid foundation for Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter05.



The code will look like the following:
```
01 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
02 <flow xmlns="urn:opendaylight:flow:inventory">
03 <flow-name>Flow1</flow-name>
04 <id>258</id>
05 <instructions>
```

In order to keep up with the book, you will need to spend some time learning basic coding.
Ensure that you have the following software installed:

* Oracle VirtualBox Or VMware workstation
* Ubuntu 16 server as base operating system for installation of OpenDaylight
* Mininet virtual appliance
* OpenDaylight Beryllium-SR4
* VTN coordinator
* PacketFence module for OpenDaylight
